  ,abstract     = {We present a compositional encoding of the gamma-calculus
                  into the pi-calculus. The former, used in the Oz semantics,
                  is a recent small language with equational constraints over
                  logical variables; the latter is a basic calculus of
                  interacting processes. We establish a close correspondence
                  between the reductions in the gamma-calculus and its
                  encoding, using weak barbed bisimulation congruence.}
