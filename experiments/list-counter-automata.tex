Consider the following single-threaded program. It scans a list
starting from the pointer $L$ and must end when it finds a marker $P$,
placed prior to the start of the program. %
In this case, the parameter for this parametrized system if the length
of the list.
%
The program risks a segmentation fault is the marker $P$ is not
found. Our analysis retain the presence of the marker information in a
context (and would forget it without context).
